The increasing speed at which cybercriminals exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities 

makes it difficult for security teams to respond quickly and effectively. Manual analysis of 

large volumes of data from open sources, such as social media and forums, is time-consuming 

and prone to human error. Existing methods for threat detection, like keyword filtering, 

generate too many false positives and lack accurate threat profiling. Security analysts need a 

more efficient way to automatically identify, classify, and profile emerging cyber threats from 

unstructured, real-time data sources. There is a need for a system that can integrate machine 

learning and NLP to not only detect threats but also provide insights into their intentions and 

associated risks.
